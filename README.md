## üéØ Overview

The **Mouse Phone App** allows you to control your computer's cursor and mouse clicks using your smartphone as a wireless touchpad. It is ideal for giving presentations, using your computer as a media center, or for anyone looking for a more convenient way to interact with their PC from a distance.

The app is designed for an intuitive user experience, with a fast, low-latency connection established over your local Wi-Fi network.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Remote Mouse Control:** Move your computer's cursor with gestures on your phone's screen.
- **Left & Right Clicks:** Dedicated buttons to simulate mouse clicks.
- **Simple Connection:** Easily connect to the desktop agent using its IP address and port.
- **Clean Interface:** A modern and minimalist UI built with Jetpack Compose.
- **(Future) QR Code Connection:** Planned functionality for an even faster setup.
- **(Future) Gyroscope Control:** Use your phone's motion sensors to control the cursor.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is based on a client-server model that communicates over a local network (Wi-Fi) using the WebSocket protocol.

- **Mobile App (This Repository):** An Android application that captures user gestures on the screen, formats them into JSON, and sends them to the Desktop Agent.
- **Desktop Agent (Server):** A Go server that creates a WebSocket endpoint. It is responsible for receiving messages, interpreting them, and using operating system APIs to control the mouse.
